**(i) Theoretical linguistics**

- Formal linguistics, generative syntax;
- Comparative syntax: Chinese, Chinese dialects, French, English, Qiangic languages.

**Research topics:**

• The Minimalist Program: MERGE and its properties (Markovian MERGE, free MERGE, etc.), Workspace, (long distance) Agree, Move, Phase, Labeling;
Adjunction and labeling;

• A’-dependency: interrogative constructions,wh-in-situ, wh-ex-situ, topicalization, cleft-sentences, relativization, resumption, non-standard interrogatives, locality, islands;

• Cartography: left periphery, Sentence-Final Particles, functional projections under the Split-CP hypothesis;

• Nominal structures and DP; 

• Quantification: scope-taking, bound variable, gap, resumptive pronoun;

• Diachronic Chinese syntax: object-fronting

• Interface: syntax-semantics, syntax-information structure, syntax-prosody;

**(ii) Heritage language and language contact**

• Oversea Chinese and Wu dialects;

**(iii) Minority and endangered languages (Sino-Tibetan)**

• Language documentation and morpho-syntax of Qiangic languages: nDrapa;

**(iv) Neurolinguistics with formal syntax as theoretical background, brain and langue**

• A’-dependency: gap, *pro* and resumption.
