**(i) Theoretical linguistics**

- Formal linguistics, generative syntax;
- Comparative syntax: Chinese, Chinese dialects, French, English, Qiangic languages.

**Research topics:**

• The Minimalist Program: MERGE and its properties (Markovian MERGE, free MERGE, etc.), Workspace, (long distance) Agree, Move, Phase, Labeling (since 2004);
Adjunction and labeling (since 2019);

• A’-dependency: interrogative constructions,wh-in-situ, wh-ex-situ, topicalization, cleft-sentences, relativization, resumption, non-standard interrogatives, locality, islands (since 2004);

• Cartography: left periphery, Sentence-Final Particles, functional projections under the Split-CP hypothesis (since 2004);

• Nominal structures and DP (since 2022); 

• Quantification: scope-taking, bound variable, gap, resumptive pronoun (since 2008);

• Diachronic Chinese syntax (since 2021): object-fronting

• Interface: syntax-semantics, syntax-information structure, syntax-prosody (since 2004);

**(ii) Heritage language and language contact**

• Oversea Chinese and Wu dialects  (since 2022);

**(iii) Minority and endangered languages (Sino-Tibetan)**

• Language documentation and morpho-syntax of Qiangic languages: nDrapa (since 2024);

**(iv) Neurolinguistics with formal syntax as theoretical background, brain and langue**

• A’-dependency: gap, pro (since 2025).
