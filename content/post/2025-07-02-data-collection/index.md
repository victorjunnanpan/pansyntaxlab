Team members, Zetao Xu (group leader), Chenghao Hu, Xiangyu Li and Zhongyang Yu, are doing data collection of nDrapa language in the West of Sichuan. The documentation and projection of this endangered language is very urgent! Our team works closely with native speakers of nDrapa and Prof Yang Huang from Southwest Jiaotong University, who is an expert of this langauge.
