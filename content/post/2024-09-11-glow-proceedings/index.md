**Abstract**
This volume contains regular talks and posters presented at the 14th Generative Linguistics in the Old World in Asia (GLOW in Asia XIV) 2024, Hong Kong, on March 6- 8, 2024. Following the successful hosting of GLOW in Asia VI and GLOW in Asia XIV at the Chinese University of Hong Kong in 2007 and in 2022, we are once again honored to host GLOW in Asia XIV. Thanks to the support from the colleagues, we received a substantial number of abstracts from all over the world. A total of 15 regular talks and 34 posters were presented during the three-day conference. All of the talks represented most up-to-date research findings in a wide range of subfields in generative linguistics. We were privileged to have six distinguished scholars to present their research as the keynotespeeches:LuigiRizzi(CollègedeFrance),HisatsuguKitahara(KeioUniversity), Caterina Donati (Université Paris Cité), Rajesh Bhatt (University of Massachusetts Amherst), Roberta D’Alessandro (Utrecht University), Željko Bošković (University of Connecticut). The conference drew over 100 participants and we had excellent discussions throughout the three days. We thank The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Faculty of Arts, Department of Linguistics and Modern Languages, and New Asia College for their generous funding; we would also like to thank Prof. Mamoru Saito from Nanzan University, Prof. Anoop Mahajan from University of California Los Angeles, and other GLOW in Asia executive committee members: Prof. Wei-Tien Dylan Tsai, Prof. Tanmoy Bhattacharya, Prof. Myung-Kwan Park, Prof. Koji Sugisaki and Prof. Yuji Takano. Finally, we express our deepest gratitude to the abstract reviewers who have contributed to the overall quality of the conference.
