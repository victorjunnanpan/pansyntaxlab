**Abstract**
In this paper, we examine the distribution and syntactic properties of two types of nominal modifiers in Mandarin Chinese: de-less modifiers and deP-modifiers. This paper proposes a model for labeling nominal phrases, including relative clauses treated as deP-modifiers. These nominal modifiers exhibit distinct syntactic properties. Under a framework based on labeling, deP-modifiers are analyzed as being merged into a labeled structure, whereas de-less modifiers give rise to an unlabeled structure. Adhering to Labeling Algorithm, our model systematically derives several basic nominal structures in Chinese. In terms of labeling a phrase-phrase merge, feature-sharing may occur between two matched unvalued features. Moreover, we also address ungrammatical sequences in Chinese nominals, ascribing them to either labeling failures or Antilocality. Considering the implications of Antilocality in the derivation, this model suggests a universal syntactic D-layer in Chinese nominals.
