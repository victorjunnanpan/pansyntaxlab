On February 4, 2025, Professor Mamoru Saito (Notre Dame Seishin University) gave a talk titled “Discourse particles and selection: Implications for the model of syntax” for the research seminar at the Department of Linguistics and Modern Languages, The Chinese University of Hong Kong. He presented a new perspective on explaining the hierarchy of sentence-final particles, i.e. through their selectional properties and speech acts rather than fixed cartographical structure. He adopts a multi-dimensional derivation model initially proposed in Pan and Du (2024).
