**Abstract**
This paper examines higher readings, such as “denial”, “causal” and “reason”, and lower readings, such as “instrumental”, “manner” and “purpose”, of wh-adverbials zenme ‘how’ and weishenme ‘why’. In particular, we will discuss the (un)availability of these readings when the relevant wh-words cooccur with the universal quantifier dou ‘all’. The higher readings are unavailable when the relevant wh-adverbials follow dou, which is because as an adverb, dou is not able to be topicalized into a position higher than the functional projections hosting the higher readings. By contrast, the lower readings are not available when the relevant wh-adverbials precede dou, which is because dou is based-generated in a position higher than the projections hosting the lower readings. This analysis will be extended to explain the (un)availability of these readings when the relevant wh-words cooccur with modals such as hui ‘will’, frequency adverbs, temporal adverbials, locational adverbials and certain sentence-final particles. The interaction between wh-nominals with dou will also be examined.
